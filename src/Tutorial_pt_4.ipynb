    "## How to use the interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caveat\n",
    "\n",
    "*The sequential SAR change detection method that we developed in the first three parts of this tutorial is _pixel-oriented_. That is to say, it is based entirely on the statistical properties of each and every multi-look pixel in the observed image series. For this reason it is best to limit your analysis to a region less than a few thousand square kilometers while interactively visualizing and exploring results using this notebook (for larger regions, [export the results](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install#exporting-data)). Furthermore, since we are analysing time series for changes, the reflectance images involved must all completely overlap the region of interest and have been irradiated from the same position in space. This means choosing either ascending **or** descending node, and only **one** relative orbit number for any given sequence.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Walk through\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, let's see how to generate a small change map. In the widget interface above, choose **Platform** A, leaving all other settings as is. Select a small area of interest (aoi) near the town of JÃ¼lich with the rectangular or polygon **draw tool**. This will enable the **Collect** button. Click it to collect an image series, the details of which are printed in the info box at the bottom. The raster overlay shows the complete swath of the last image in the sequence. When the overlay is fully rendered, the **Preview** button is enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Depending on the position of the aoi, two relative orbit numbers may be displayed (88 and 15). If so, in the corresponding **RelOrbit** field choose either of them and re-collect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Preview** button will  now trigger the change detection algorithm at the scale selected by the current zoom setting. The color coded change map is displayed, showing, for each pixel, the interval within the series of the **First** detected change (palette = 'black, blue, cyan, yellow, red' indicating early in the series through to late). The map displayed is set by the Radio Button next to **Preview**.  Since processing is carried out in parallel, the change image is built up tile-by-tile. As explained in [Part 3](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/detecting-changes-in-sentinel-1-imagery-pt-3#a_question_of_scale)  of this tutorial, the zoom setting can falsify the result somewhat, depending on the pyramid level at which the calculation is carried out. Nevertheless it is often convenient for generating a quick overview. You can see the effect by zooming in and out. De-select the **QuickPreview** check box to override it. Now the calculation is carried out at the full 10 m pixel scale irrespective of the zoom level chosen, but can take considerably longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If and when you are satisfied with the previewed result, you can export the change maps to your GEE cloud assets with the **ExportToAssets** button, see below.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Surveillance\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote sensing surveillance, or monitoring, applications are most often associated with very high resolution satellite or aerial sensors. The Sentinel-1 C-band ground range detected imagery on GEE is obviously much less applicable to such tasks. This is mainly due to the relatively poor spatial resolution ($\\approx 20m$) and the ever-present speckle in the archived images.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a guaranteed, all-weather revisit time of 6 days might be usefully exploited in some circumstances. Seaport activity monitoring is one possibility, with the frequency of large vessel arrival and departure (usually quoted as ATT or average turnaround time) being in general [of the order of days](https://globalmaritimehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CIRRELT-2019-20.pdf). Thus a change signal generated every 6 days from our sequential algorithm might be expected to catch a large proportion of cargo or large passenger ship movements at a given seaport.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a specific example, ports along the coast of Libya have been the subject of recent international attention, in part due to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean and also because of Libyan political instability. Some of them have been closed periodically to international traffic. The port of Benghazi was closed in the first part of 2017, [reopening on 5 October](https://www.reuters.com/article/libya-security-benghazi-port-idINKCN1C61MC). This is verified in the change frequency plots below which were generated directly from the interface. The change observations are partly confused by noise from open water, caused mostly by surface wave conditions, but the signals of interest are quite clear. (The water mask would remove the noise, but also hide some ship movements.)\n",

    "\n",
    "In [Part 3](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/detecting-changes-in-sentinel-1-imagery-pt-3) of this series we used a catastrophic flooding event in England to introduce and illustrate the sequential change detection algorithm. This is in fact a widely known application of SAR.  Quoting from the [Office for Outer Space Affairs UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal](https://un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-flood-mapping/python-step-by-step):\n",

    "> _The usage of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery for flood extent mapping constitutes a viable solution with fast image processing, providing **near real-time flood information** (my emphasis) to relief agencies for supporting humanitarian action. The high data reliability as well as the absence of geographical constraints,  such as site accessibility, emphasize the technologyâs potential in the field._\n",
    "\n",
    "And here, as another illustration, is an excerpt from [Canty et al. (2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/1/46):\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Cyclone Idai, recorded as the worst weather-based event to ever occur in the southern hemisphere, made landfall near the city of Beira, Mozambique on March 15, 2019 causing widespread inundation in Mozambique and Tanzania and a death toll of more than 1300. Figure 4 shows a sequence of six change maps generated with a GEE time series of Sentinel-1a and Sentinel-1b images. The reduction of reflectance from the water surfaces in both the VV and VH bands corresponds to a negative definite covariance matrix difference (green pixels, center left), the rapid receding of flood waters to a positive definite change (red pixels, center right)._\n",

The gray scale background is the temporal average of the VV band of all 16 images. The maps, read top to bottom, left to right, are for the intervals April 18-March 2, March 2-14, March 14-20, March 20- 26, March 26-April 1 and April 1-7.

    "The change signal from within the partially inundated city of Beira, just to the east of the scene, is considerably less convincing, as you can also verify yourself. This is due to the predominance of so-called double bounce scattering from built up areas, an effect which is present in both dry and flooded areas."

    "### Vegetation\n",
    "\n",
    "When contrasted with visual/infrared remote sensing data, individual SAR images are of relatively limited use for detecting or classifying different vegetation types. Time series of radar images (preferably speckle filtered) have some potential for supervised classification, see for example [Canty, 2021](https://gist.github.com/mortcanty/bbdaab2835334e949a45d7c3b7bf0396). If full polarimetric images are acquired by the satellite antenna (as is the case for example for the RadarSat-2 platform) then the $3\\times 3$ _quad-pol covariance matrix_ can be transformed in various ways to generate polarimetry indices for qualitative and quantitative physical information [(Moreira et al. 2013)](https://elib.dlr.de/82313/).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Equation (1.5) in Part 1](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/detecting-changes-in-sentinel-1-imagery-pt-1#single_look_complex_slc_sar_measurements) is the analogous $2\\times 2$ _dual-pol covariance matrix_ generated from the Sentinel-1 platform, and it is considerably less amenable to polarimetric methods. Also, as we know, only its diagonal elements are available in the GEE archive. But if polarimetry is not an option, we can still take advantage of the temporal information supplied by sequential change detection. As a simple example, crop dynamics in an agricultural area can be traced over a growing period to discriminate early and late harvesting, see Figure 5.\n",

As conditions deteriorated, emergency service personnel worked closely with the community around the western end of the island, and by the 2nd January, 2020 evacuations begun. On the 3rd January, 2020 the western end of the island, home to the Flinders Chase National Park, and the adjoining Ravine des Casoars Wilderness Protection area was burnt along with Kelly Hill Conservation Park.

Unless a cloud-free visual/infrared time series is available, the time at which logging took place may be difficult to determine. The SAR change image (right side of Figure 9) places it in this case at November/December, 2017, see also Figure 10. Care has to be taken to determine the _first_ changes at the location, since snowfall/snowmelt or spring/summer vegetation can generate change signals in existing clear cuts. This is apparent in Figure 10.\n",
